# AgriTech - USGS LIDAR Challenge

This projects aims to produce an easy to use, reliable and well designed python module that domain experts and data scientists can use to fetch, visualise, and transform publicly available satellite and LIDAR data. 
The size of the LIDAR data poses a challenge for people to easily fetch and use,which this implementation tries to address by using PDAL package to filter only the datapoints needed. This package is built ontop of PDAL which is provided on the refrence.




### Data
- LIDAR high definition elevation data - https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep


### Requirements
- PDAL
- GDAL
- Geopandas


#### Tasks:
- [x] Understand the business statement and needs
- [x] Interact with a public API, know how to use it 
- [x] Create tools that can be used to interact with the API in a more user friendly and effective manner
- [x] Visualize the geospatial data returned
- [ ] Document the package in an easily usable and understandable way




#### Current Status
* Understanding the business statement and needs

#### Coming Changes

* Interact with a public API to fetch data
